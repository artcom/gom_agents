## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
 * Fork the project.
 * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
 * Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
   future version unintentionally.
 * Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
   (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
    bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
 * Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
